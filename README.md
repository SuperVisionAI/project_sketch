## Explanation

- `project_sketch/`

  The Python package of this project, mostly has the same name with root folder

- `project_sketch/__init__.py`

  Essential file to claim a package, contains `__version__` variable.

- `project_sketch/_module/`

  A submodule of the project, there's also a necessary `__init__.py` under it.

  you can `cp _module what-you-like` to create a new submodule.

- `.gitignore`

  Simple, effective gitignore, much less verbose than
  [something you don't need](https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/master/Python.gitignore)

- `setup.py`

  You may hate it, but you can't ignore it. This `setup.py` do just what you want,
  and it automatically involves `requirements.txt` and `README.md`.

  If you rock, go and dig [this](https://pinboard.in/u:reorx/t:python/t:packaging).

- `Makefile`

  We love Makefile, not Rakefile or Gruntfile or whatever requires extra program.
  This awesome Makefile contains three commands at your service:

  * `make build`

    Build Python package with `setup.py`.

  * `make clean`

    Clean files & folders generated by `build`.

  * `make test`

    Run tests (if you have any) with nose.

- `manage.py`

  If you are writing some sort of service that need to be run by a complicated way,
  and you realize that the preparation code should not be put in the package,
  this is what you need. `manage.py` is a entrance script which you can customize
  your own command in it. By default, it uses [click](http://click.pocoo.org/3/)
  package, you can replace it by other things like
  [docopt](http://docopt.org/), or [fabric](http://www.fabfile.org/)
  but the file should be named `fabfile.py`, if you prefer.

  If you are writing a pure import-only package, feel free to remove it.

- `requirements.txt`

  Includes a `click` by default, this is what your package depends on.

- `dev-requirements.txt`

  Includes a `nose` by default, this is what you need in developing environment,
  but not necessary in production.

- `README.md`

  A cute, well formatted `README.md` makes people happy.  
  True heros love `README.rst`.
